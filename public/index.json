I mean, 5 out of 10 on IMDb\u0026mdash;it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be that bad, right?\nSurprisingly, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. (Spoilers ahead!)\nI loved the first movie.\nA sensitive, tender soul lives in hell and is reborn through it\u0026mdash;in the worst way imaginable. It\u0026rsquo;s a sad, tragic story, but it\u0026rsquo;s also deeply beautiful. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;literally me\u0026rdquo; thing, but I could relate, in some way.\nClearly, many others could relate, too, which explains the movie\u0026rsquo;s popularity\u0026mdash;especially among those who feel wronged by society.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t we all love a good revenge story? And what could be more universally compelling than revenge on society itself?\nAnd so, the sequel\u0026hellip;\nI think many people expected more of the same\u0026mdash;Joaquin Phoenix going on a murderous rampage, tearing through Gotham\u0026rsquo;s corrupt elite, with Lady Gaga by his side. Eat the rich! Screw the system!\nBut what we got instead was a real sequel\u0026mdash;a conclusive ending to a sad, sad story, one that had been misunderstood by many as simply an \u0026ldquo;origin story for an edgy anti-villain.\u0026rdquo;\nBy the end of the original movie, poor Arthur is hailed as a symbol by an angry mob.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the bitter truth: the mob doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about him. They care about the symbol. Arthur becomes a tool, inspiration at best, completely dispensable at worst. They never intended to save or help him.\nLady Gaga\u0026rsquo;s Harley provides an excellent reflection of that dynamic and, in my opinion, serves as the real villain of the sequel. (Society itself plays a lesser role this time, as the movie takes place almost entirely within the confines of a prison and courtroom.)\nHarley isn\u0026rsquo;t in love with Arthur. She\u0026rsquo;s in love with the Joker.\nWe watch, heartbroken, as Arthur becomes enthralled by her presence, mistaking her affections for real love\u0026mdash;the first he\u0026rsquo;s possibly ever known in his life.\nBut Harley doesn\u0026rsquo;t want Arthur. Perhaps she even detests him for not being \u0026ldquo;the Joker.\u0026rdquo; She\u0026rsquo;s infatuated with the myth, the chaos, to the extent that she declares, \u0026ldquo;The Joker is the real you.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where the movie does something truly remarkable: it allows Arthur to reject the Joker.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a brilliantly executed scene where Arthur runs away from a Joker impersonator, symbolizing his choice to shed this false identity and remain true to himself, no matter the cost.\nThe tragic finale then takes hold\u0026mdash;Harley, disappointed, abandons him, and Arthur is murdered in the prison by a random Joker fanatic.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the difference: Arthur dies as himself, not as Joker.\nSo, is it a good movie?\nI\u0026rsquo;d say\u0026mdash;yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a good movie. A fantastic sequel. An almost perfect deconstruction of a character.\nIt likely took immense courage for the director to make such a bold narrative choice. For that, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but respect him\u0026mdash;haters be damned.\n","date":"24 January 2025","permalink":"/posts/joker-folie-a-deux-is-a-good-movie/","section":"Blog","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s not a hill I would die on, but maybe this post will change somebody\u0026rsquo;s opinion?","title":"Joker: Folie a Deux Is A Good Movie"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/movie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Movie"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/review/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Review"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/blogging/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blogging"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/life/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Life"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/meta/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Meta"},{"content":"Late in 2024, I decided that I wanted to start a blog.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a new year\u0026rsquo;s resolution, challenge, or a personal brand development thing.\nI just noticed that lately there are things that I want to say - not just to my friends and family, but to anybody who\u0026rsquo;s willing to listen.\nThese are not grand things, and probably not especially insightful. It\u0026rsquo;s not like a portal to a higher plane opened inside me and creative thoughts suddenly started to stream, begging to be materialized in some way. But I do want to say them, and I\u0026rsquo;d probably be excited to find someone who thinks in the same vein.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I expect from this blog (and you should, too):\na couple of posts per month, maybe less a diverse array of topics, covering whatever I come in touch with and find interesting: programming, tech, personal projects, introspection, movies, travel, music, books\u0026hellip; The list goes on, but I\u0026rsquo;ll try not to be all over the place. some hot takes and some that will seem lukewarm an RSS feed if there will be more than 5 readers (I like to dream big) zero pictures, unless relevant I\u0026rsquo;ll be using Hugo to generate the site and Obsidian.md to draft posts (I\u0026rsquo;m writing this one with it!).
