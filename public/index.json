I don\u0026rsquo;t think they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to replace a proper developer yet - not until they\u0026rsquo;re able to guess people\u0026rsquo;s unexpressed wishes and actually resolve bugs. But they are an excellent tool if you don\u0026rsquo;t expect actual intelligence from them.\nIn this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll list:\nthings that LLMs are a great help for things where LLMs can help if used cautiously things that LLMs are not ready to do yet (and perhaps never will) The Setup #I use librechat.ai, hosted through Coolify on my Hetzner instance. It allows me to use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and DeepSeek\u0026rsquo;s models from one interface, build my own agents, and more. API costs are significantly lower than having a subscription - I usually go through $10 in a couple of months. I am quite happy with this setup.\nNow, to the list!\nThe Good #Kickstarting a task. LLMs are great for this, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re tired or have a fear of blank page. What I usually do is prompt an LLM with \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m starting work on X. (optionally I list my first thoughts and assumptions) What do you think?\u0026rdquo;\nI rarely get something useful from the LLM\u0026rsquo;s answer per se. But I do often get some leads and new thoughts. Sometimes I disagree with the LLM\u0026rsquo;s output and that creates an impulse to think, which is cool.\nMind the anchoring, though.\nProofreading. I\u0026rsquo;m quite confident in my English - too confident, I\u0026rsquo;d say (I know it\u0026rsquo;s not perfect). Sometimes I run my texts through an LLM just to see if I missed something.\nThey are also a great source of inspiration - there are times when I want to change the tone of my writing to more/less professional, but don\u0026rsquo;t know where to start. I often ask an LLM to rewrite my text just to get an idea of how my text could look like after I change the tone. This is only for inspiration though - I don\u0026rsquo;t feel right using the LLM\u0026rsquo;s output as is.\nSmall refactorings. Split a huge method into a couple of small ones, abstract an interface, make code more concise and readable, etc - LLMs are pretty good at this, but only when you can tell how good the results are (because sometimes they screw up).\nWriting scripts. LLMs are awesome for writing short, one-off scripts, especially in Python. Their shortcomings do not come up too much here, and I am usually able to describe what the script needs to do in a few bullet points which keeps the friction low.\nThe Sometimes Good #Looking for information. I never trust LLMs, because they don\u0026rsquo;t know right from wrong. That\u0026rsquo;s why replacing Google with an LLM is a double-edged sword - it does work fast, but it can give you complete nonsense with the confidence of a 7-year**-old.\nMajor LLM providers are adding \u0026ldquo;grounding\u0026rdquo; in actual internet searches as an inherent feature now, but it still is shaky. LLMs still can\u0026rsquo;t differentiate between a trustworthy source and an obviously untrustworthy one.\nWhat I do for now is use LLMs for search if I have absolutely no idea about the topic I\u0026rsquo;m searching, and use their output as a starting point. It works\u0026hellip;alright, I suppose?\nSummarising. LLMs are good at this. But to summarise a text is to understand it; if I want to understand a text, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to summarise it myself. Giving the task to an LLM is probably fine for mundane tasks? Although, to be honest, I\u0026rsquo;d prefer people would write concisely to begin with.\nThe Bad #Working with big context. Even though some models can hold a medium-sized app in their context now, they are still horrible with anything that actually requires such big context.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something missing from LLMs that prevents them from doing a good job with tasks that span across the whole codebase. Maybe this is actual intelligence? Who knows, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even try medium or huge refactorings in enterprise codebases using LLM agents right now. (using LLMs for small tasks on a per-file basis is still great)\nWorking with non-mainstream technologies. I have tried to get LLMs to help with Godot game engine, and it\u0026rsquo;s been pretty awful. Sometimes they mess up different versions of it, sometimes they try to gaslight me into tweaking settings that are not there. Sometimes they work fine, though.\nThis is somehow mitigated with enabling search.\nVibe coding. Maybe my use cases were too niche, or maybe I\u0026rsquo;m too poor an overseer, but almost every time I tried to get LLMs to write a complete solution it went terribly. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;working with big context\u0026rdquo; problem all over again.\nFinal Thoughts #LLMs are not an AI by any means, but they can make a software engineer\u0026rsquo;s life easier. Do not trust them, do not treat them like a human, don\u0026rsquo;t expect reliability and accountability - and you\u0026rsquo;re good.\n","date":"25 May 2025","permalink":"/posts/things-i-use-and-dont-llms-for-in-2025/","section":"Blog","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s not an actual intellingence, but it is useful","title":"Things I use (and don't) LLMs for in 2025"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/tools/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tools"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/efficiency/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Efficiency"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/harmony/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Harmony"},{"content":"I used to be big on productivity stuff - finding the right app, the right flow, the right system.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried GTD, Agile Results, Kanban, and even PARA; Wunderlist, Todoist, TickTick, Microsoft ToDo, Notion, Obsidian, and others.\nAs it often happens, I came to the conclusion that all the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; stuff has to be deduced by oneself. Maybe you build on others\u0026rsquo; ideas, but ultimately it comes down to trial, error, and observation of your habits and patterns. Your system has to be created by you, not a productivity blogger.\nIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll cover one part of my system - how I plan and structure my day.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s define my acceptance criteria for a day planning/structuring method:\nLow maintenance (I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend too much time keeping my system in order) Some kind of motivation, or at least no demotivation (the system should be a helping hand and a guiding star, not a supervisor) Not too rigid (see previous points) Not too loose (so that I have some kind of order to keep me going) Rest is a task, too (I have a tendency to dive too greedily and too deep into interesting projects, and burn out) So, how do I plan and structure my day? Enter the GRRR method.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really simple. Each daily to-do list has 4 sections (be it on paper or in an app):\nGoals Responsibilities Recharge Rituals When I plan my day (usually the night before), I make sure I have something in each section:\nGoals - I want to work on moving towards my goals. For me, these are learning, career, and whatever else is on my goal list this year/quarter/week. Responsibilities - this list always fills as if by itself. Basically, these are the tasks that are not related to my goals - day job, chores, etc. Recharge - this is where I make sure I have enough energy. If I feel my energy dwindling, I put some rest in there. Hobbies and fun projects go there, too. Rituals - these are my good habits and regular tasks that help me keep going, like meditation, planning, note review, etc. Responsibilities and Rituals usually are packed, so it all comes down to:\nMaking sure I work on my goals Making sure I get some rest It sounds easy - and it is! I find that easy systems are easy to stick with. And while GRRR method is what works for me, I hope you come up with an idea or two to make your life easier.

I mean, 5 out of 10 on IMDb\u0026mdash;it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be that bad, right?\nSurprisingly, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. (Spoilers ahead!)\nI loved the first movie.\nA sensitive, tender soul lives in hell and is reborn through it\u0026mdash;in the worst way imaginable. It\u0026rsquo;s a sad, tragic story, but it\u0026rsquo;s also deeply beautiful. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a \u0026ldquo;literally me\u0026rdquo; thing, but I could relate, in some way.\nClearly, many others could relate, too, which explains the movie\u0026rsquo;s popularity\u0026mdash;especially among those who feel wronged by society.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t we all love a good revenge story? And what could be more universally compelling than revenge on society itself?\nAnd so, the sequel\u0026hellip;\nI think many people expected more of the same\u0026mdash;Joaquin Phoenix going on a murderous rampage, tearing through Gotham\u0026rsquo;s corrupt elite, with Lady Gaga by his side. Eat the rich! Screw the system!\nBut what we got instead was a real sequel\u0026mdash;a conclusive ending to a sad, sad story, one that had been misunderstood by many as simply an \u0026ldquo;origin story for an edgy anti-villain.\u0026rdquo;\nBy the end of the original movie, poor Arthur is hailed as a symbol by an angry mob.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the bitter truth: the mob doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about him. They care about the symbol. Arthur becomes a tool, inspiration at best, completely dispensable at worst. They never intended to save or help him.\nLady Gaga\u0026rsquo;s Harley provides an excellent reflection of that dynamic and, in my opinion, serves as the real villain of the sequel. (Society itself plays a lesser role this time, as the movie takes place almost entirely within the confines of a prison and courtroom.)\nHarley isn\u0026rsquo;t in love with Arthur. She\u0026rsquo;s in love with the Joker.\nWe watch, heartbroken, as Arthur becomes enthralled by her presence, mistaking her affections for real love\u0026mdash;the first he\u0026rsquo;s possibly ever known in his life.\nBut Harley doesn\u0026rsquo;t want Arthur. Perhaps she even detests him for not being \u0026ldquo;the Joker.\u0026rdquo; She\u0026rsquo;s infatuated with the myth, the chaos, to the extent that she declares, \u0026ldquo;The Joker is the real you.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where the movie does something truly remarkable: it allows Arthur to reject the Joker.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a brilliantly executed scene where Arthur runs away from a Joker impersonator, symbolizing his choice to shed this false identity and remain true to himself, no matter the cost.\nThe tragic finale then takes hold\u0026mdash;Harley, disappointed, abandons him, and Arthur is murdered in the prison by a random Joker fanatic.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the difference: Arthur dies as himself, not as Joker.\nSo, is it a good movie?\nI\u0026rsquo;d say\u0026mdash;yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a good movie. A fantastic sequel. An almost perfect deconstruction of a character.\nIt likely took immense courage for the director to make such a bold narrative choice. For that, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but respect him\u0026mdash;haters be damned.\n","date":"24 January 2025","permalink":"/posts/joker-folie-a-deux-is-a-good-movie/","section":"Blog","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s not a hill I would die on, but maybe this post will change somebody\u0026rsquo;s opinion?","title":"Joker: Folie a Deux Is A Good Movie"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/movie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Movie"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/review/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Review"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/blogging/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Blogging"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/life/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Life"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/meta/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Meta"},{"content":"Late in 2024, I decided that I wanted to start a blog.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a new year\u0026rsquo;s resolution, challenge, or a personal brand development thing.\nI just noticed that lately there are things that I want to say - not just to my friends and family, but to anybody who\u0026rsquo;s willing to listen.\nThese are not grand things, and probably not especially insightful.
