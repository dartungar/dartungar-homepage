Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan - I write code for work and fun.

My usual tools:

- C#/.NET/ASP.NET
- AWS (I am certified!)
- SQL (Postgres & SQL Server)
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React & Angular
- Python

I've worked with all sorts of companies, from tiny startups to big corporations. Good at keeping things organized and making sure stuff gets done (without being a pain about it).

My non-work projects can be found [here](/projects). 

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:

- Reading (mostly non-fiction, history, and sci-fi)
- Learning
- Exploring new places
- Drawing
- Enjoying music
- Hanging out with my wife and/or friends

Always up for meeting interesting people and working on cool things. [Drop me a line!](/contact)
