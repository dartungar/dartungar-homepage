title: "Starting a blog in 2025"
---

Late in 2024, I decided that I wanted to start a blog.

It's not a new year's resolution, challenge, or a personal brand development thing.

I just noticed that lately there are things that I want to say - not just to my friends and family, but to anybody who's willing to listen.

These are not grand things, and probably not especially insightful.
It's not like a portal to a higher plane opened inside me and creative thoughts suddenly started to stream, begging to be materialized in some way.
But I *do* want to say them, and I'd probably be excited to find someone who thinks in the same vein.

Here's what I expect from this blog (and you should, too):
- a couple of posts per month, maybe less
- a diverse array of topics, covering whatever I come in touch with and find interesting: programming, tech, personal projects, introspection, movies, travel, music, books... The list goes on, but I'll try not to be all over the place.
- some hot takes and some that will seem lukewarm
- an RSS feed if there will be more than 5 readers (I like to dream big)
- zero pictures, unless relevant

I'll be using Hugo to generate the site and Obsidian.md to draft posts (I'm writing this one with it!).
I might use LLMs to proofread some texts (English is not a native language for me), but I'll definitely not use them for writing. This blog will be a labor of love, or empty.

Well, here's to this blog having more than one post!
